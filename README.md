# Genome-Resolved Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics of R3R4 EBPR Bioreactors

This repository contains code, workflows, and metadata for assembling and analyzing co-occurring Accumulibacter populations using genome-resolved metagenomics and exploring expression profiles over an EBPR cycle with metatranscriptomics. The goal of this project was to understand expression patterns of co-existing Accumulibacter strains using genome-resolved metagenomics and time-series transcriptomics. This analysis was performed for the publication: 

McDaniel E.A., Moya-Flores F., Keene Beach N., Camejo P.Y., Oyserman B.O., Kizarik M., Khor E.H., Noguera D.N., McMahon K.D. **Metabolic differentiation of co-occurring Accumulibacter clades revealed through genome-resolved metatranscriptomics.** _bioRxiv._ Nov. 2020.
